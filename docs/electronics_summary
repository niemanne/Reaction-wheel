## Why this setup?
These electronics were chosen to match the needs of my single-axis reaction wheel rectangular prism focused on stabilizing along the z-axis. The components were chosen based on their simplicity, dimensions, and controllability while also allowing an ease of code transfer from breadboard prototyping with common Ardunio logic to higher level electronics that still follow the Ardunio language.
