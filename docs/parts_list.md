## üß† Notes

- Servo motors are **not** suitable for this project due to their limited rotation.
- Relay modules and IR receivers are unnecessary for a closed-loop balancing system.
- Use LiPo batteries instead of alkaline or carbon-based due to **higher current output**, lighter weight, and **rechargeability**.
- The L298N is widely used, but consider heat dissipation for continuous use.
