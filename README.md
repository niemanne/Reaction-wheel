# Reaction-wheel

This is a personal aerospace engineering project to simulate 1-axis attitude control using a reaction wheel system. This project is built from scratch using Arduino, NX, and circuit diagrams.

## Goals
- Learn spacecraft attitude control concepts
- Build a functinonal stabilization cube
- Practice real-time sensor integration and feedback
- Learn how to work with circuits and ece concepts
- Document the process

## Timeline
July-August 2025 (6 weeks, self-directed)

Week 1: Design + research hardware (IMU, motors, microcontroller)

Week 2: Build test rig + set up electronics

Week 3: Program basic motor control + IMU data logging

Week 4: Implement attitude control algorithm (PID control)

Week 5: Tune system + make demo videos

Week 6: Polish, document, review
